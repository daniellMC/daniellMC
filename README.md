<h2 align="left">ðŸ‘‹ >_Hello!</h2>
Greetings! I am a full-stack developer who has accumulated experience over a number of years, mainly through involvement in personal and school projects. I have a strong passion for programming and am delving into cybersecurity which is my current area of interest through different courses and self-teaching. I enjoy staying updated with the latest trends as well as coding best practices.
